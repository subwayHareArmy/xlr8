Team Snowball's solution for the Mercedes-Benz Digital Challenge, India.

## Project Description

BCG reports that this number for Indians is between 1.3 and 1.6 times additional time in peak traffic amongst Asian cities. Today the average worker in urban India spends around 7% of their day in the office commute. In urban areas, traffic is the bottleneck for mobility, not the road infrastructure itself. Rapid urbanization is straining the transport network, and it necessitates a solution for the problem of congestion.

Congestion is a popular mathematical metric used in the world of route planning as a measure of the flow of traffic in a given road network. The problem at hand is to increase the overall mobility of the vehicles in the road network, i.e. reduce the time taken by the cars to reach their destinations.

Our idea posits an app similar to Google Maps with a new route planning algorithm - one that takes source and destination information for each vehicle using the app and computes the optimum route individually for each car such that the overall congestion is minimized. Keeping the principles the same, the same idea can be used to increase route planning efficiency for any high traffic transport system - aviation, railways, etc. The algorithm increases the mobility of all cars, ensuring optimum usage of the road infrastructure.

The algorithm can be used for route planning in commercial ride hailing applications, in fulfilment and delivery providers, and with emergency response services like ambulances and police vehicles as well. With minimal changes, the algorithm can be used for trips including multiple modes of transport as well. Another interesting use-case is for the self-driving cars of the future which would all be routed through a centralized platform. SInce our algorithm shows maximum improvement when applied large, dense vehicle networks, it would be very useful in this context.

This solution presented can scale well with Quantum Computing and other emerging technologies as well and thus can be a useful solution in the long term.
